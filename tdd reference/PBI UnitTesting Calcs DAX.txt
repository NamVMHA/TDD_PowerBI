Unit Testing Framework Results = 

/* Instructions
    Unit Testing Framework is defined as a cross join between the TestFieldList (generic) and the TestMeasureList (specific to model).
    Each Measure to test requires a UnitTestComputation measure to go with it.

    This measure generates the outcome for each cell.

    The form is as follows:
    The Target Values have been inputted with the Measure name associated with it in the UnitTestValues data table.
    The Calculated Values are defined as specific Measures by YOU (and to be input below)
    The Result is the Target Value minus the Calculated Value. These need to fall within variance levels to pass the test.
*/

// Get current Measure name from Matrix.
VAR _msr = SELECTEDVALUE(_TestValues[ID])
// Get current Field Type from Matrix.
VAR _fld = SELECTEDVALUE(TestFieldList[UnitTests])

VAR _calc = // Each Measure has 3 outputs to provide within the nested SWITCH. I know, it's ugly.
    SWITCH(
        _msr
//        , 1, SWITCH(_fld, "Target Value", [TV 001], "Calculated Value", [CV 001], "Result", [UT 001])
//        , 1, SWITCH(_fld, "Target Value", [TV], "Calculated Value", [CV 001], "Result", [UT 001]) // Alternate approach.
        , -1 // Any non-implemented tests will show up as -1
